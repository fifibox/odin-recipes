    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with egg, hard cheese, guanciale, and pepper. The recipe is not fixed by a specific type of hard cheese or pasta. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Either guanciale or pancetta can be used. The dish was created in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
