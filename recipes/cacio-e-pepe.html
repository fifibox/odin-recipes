    <p>Cacio e pepe is a simple Roman pasta dish that is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. The key to this recipe is to toss the pasta and cheese quickly to create a creamy sauce. The heat from the pasta will melt the cheese and create a smooth sauce. The dish is traditionally made with Pecorino Romano cheese, but Parmigiano-Reggiano can also be used.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p> 4 servings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>320g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grate the Pecorino Romano cheese and set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta back to the pot and place over low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese to the pasta and toss quickly to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved cooking water.</li>
        <li>Divide the pasta among plates and top with freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
